# GeoQuiz2
geoquiz final project
The geoquiz app is a quiz app that challenges users on geography questions from all over the world. The initial geoquiz app asked users 5 questions and included some extra
funcionalities like a score and a cheating feature. In my final project for Post-AP CS: App Dev, I will be working on extending this app using my creativity. My
extension of the geoquiz app will now allow users to choose what types of questions they want to answer, based on region. Ex: User can choose to answer questions
about north america. It will also include a recycler view to show log history of the users quiz sessions. Ex: After a user finishes Asia and gets 4/5, the recycler view will hold 
an entry "Asia - 80%." Specific topics that I will add are additional activities, a recycler view, toasts, buttons, and themes/styling. 

4/21 - created new main activity, so users now see the 4 different regions as buttons
